# Chip-8 Emulator with Tests

This is a Chip-8 emulator project that allows you to play games and programs written in the Chip-8 programming language. The emulator is implemented in c++ and comes with a comprehensive set of tests to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- Emulation of the Chip-8 virtual machine.
- Graphics rendering.
- A set of unit tests for each component of the emulator.

   
## Usage

The emulator can be controlled using your keyboard. The default key mapping is as follows:

```
Chip-8 Keypad         Keyboard
-------------         ---------
1 2 3 C               1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D      -->      Q W E R
7 8 9 E               A S D F
A 0 B F               Z X C V
```

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the correctness of the emulator's components. The tests cover memory and graphics. 

The test suite will execute various test cases and report the results.


## Acknowledgments

This emulator was worked on during the final Programming class at AIV (Accdemia Italiana Videogiochi) and I'm still working on it.
